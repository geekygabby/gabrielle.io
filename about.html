<h1>Meet Gabrielle</h1>
<p>As a passionate and detail-oriented software and web developer, I specialize in creating responsive, user-friendly applications and web experiences. I have hands-on experience in web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Tailwind, and a strong foundation in APIs and JSON integration, having built applications that leverage Google Books, Open Library, and TMDb APIs. I also bring solid experience with databases and backend data handling, along with proficiency in Python, C#, and C for software development and scripting. My understanding of network analysis and cybersecurity fundamentals, including Wireshark, strengthens my ability to design secure and efficient systems. Driven by problem-solving and a commitment to quality, I thrive in environments where I can combine technical skills with creativity to deliver practical, scalable solutions. I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to innovative teams and continue expanding my expertise in software engineering, web development, and secure application design.</p>
